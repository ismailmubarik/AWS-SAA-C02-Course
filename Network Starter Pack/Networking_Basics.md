### OSI 7-Layer Model
The OSI Model is a conceptual thing and not necessairly how the software is implemented.

Conceptually your phone, laptop, wifi, server (cantril course) has this networking stack.

Media Layer deals with how data is moved from Point A to Point B. The two Points i.e. A & B can be within the same network or the opposite sides of the planet.

The host layers deals with chopping/re-assembling for transaport and formatting the data so that it is understandable by both nodes on the network.

On a High Level we can have FireFox (or any web broswer) surfing a website on a webserver. At the bottom we have physical network cards/interfaces. Conceptually the data from the
web browser flows down to the NIC-1. THe data from From NIC-1 arrives at NIC-2 and then to the webserver. This is a highly abstracted or birds-eye view

### Layer 1 - Physical

Layer - 1 device mean it only understand Layer - 1. Layer -3 device means it has functionality for Layer-3.2 & 1.

A Hub is basically, 4-connector network cable. Layer-1 is basically a broadcast medium and there are no addresses.
It like shouting in a room with 3 other people and not naming any names.

The more devices are present on a layer-1 network the more are chances of layer-1. That's why layer-1 networks don't
scale well.

Devices on the layer-1 network needs to have same layer-1 medium and device standards. Meaning a certain type of network
card and cable, or wifi cards

### Layer 2 - Data Link Layer
Layer 2 is critical because everything depends on the device to device communication it provides. Layer 2 works on top of Layer 1 so a functional Layer 1 is required for Layer 2
communications. Layer 2 can run on different types of Layer-1 mediums and provide the same type of capabilities.

A Frame is a format for sending data over Layer-2 network. It is a container of sorts.

A Mac Address for physical networking is not software assigned rather it is a **unique** address attached to a physical device.

A layer-2 frame is given to Layer-1 i.e. the physical medium which transmits it on the physical medium. Layer-1 doesn't understand the contents of the frame. It just sends the
frame as a sequence of 0s and 1s.

**Frame Parts:**
Preamble & Start Frame Delimiter (SFD) - Their functions is to let the devices know that it is the start of the frame.
Source MAC Address
Destination MAC Address - All Fs for Broadcast
Ether Type (ET) - Commonly used to specify which Layer-3 protocol is putting its data inside the Layer-2 frame (Layer-3 uses Layer-2 frames for device-device communication on a local network).
PayLoad- Data that the frame is sending. The data is provided by layer-3. 
FCS - Frame Check Sequence which is CRC-check to ascertain if data corruption has occured.

The data generated by layer-3 inside the frame is encapsulated by the other frame parts. Often type its an IP packet generated by layer-3 encapsulated inside an Ethernet Frame. The frame deliver the data to a layer-2 destination. The frame is analyzed the data interpreted and then extracted and given to destination layer-3.

**Layer-2 CSMA/CD**
